The International School on Tool-based Rigorous Engineering of Software 
Systems (STRESS) :ref:`series <series>` aims to provide top-quality lectures and
innovative pedagogical material that provide young researchers with:
 
* instruction in existing and emerging formal methods and software 
  engineering techniques that are tool-supported and process-oriented,
  
* insights into how software is developed in the real world, including 
  emphasis on domains such as safety/mission-critical software and
  embedded systems where the development effort associated with tool-based
  formal methods promises greatest returns,
  
* case-studies and example domains in which formal methods have been
  successfully transitioned into actual development along with insights in
  how to bridge the gap between research tools and actual development
  processes, and
  
* additional pedagogical resources and personal contacts that they can
  explore for the purpose of increasing the impact of their research.

In addition to STRESS 2021,
the `ISoLA <http://www.isola-conference.org/isola2021/>`__ week
offers a lot of opportunites besides the standard conference program,
which addresses in particular also PhD students:

* The RERS challenge provides an ideal opportunity to check one's own
  verification competence. During the challenge you will meet world
  leading experts in tool-based software verification.
  http://www.rers-challenge.org
  
* The industrial day will give an impression of today's needs industry.
